  <h2>EMU Theatre&nbsp;</h2>
      <p><strong>2023 - Now</strong><br>
        I've been involved in EMU Theatre since I was a freshman here at Eastern. In that time, I've been apart of 8 productions. I've also been a crew lead for 3 productions now and have the opportunity to design within the next year.</p>
  <h2> IHS Drama Troupe 363</h2>
	 <p><strong>2019 - 2023</strong><br>
		 During all four of my years in high school I was involved in theatre. During that time I did 7 productions and worked on various crews such as Lighting, Set, Design, and Pit Band. During my senior year I was the Vice President of the program and operated all of the social media for the club.</p>
  
  <h2>Children's Theatre Workshop </h2>
	<p><strong>2017 - 2019</strong><br>
 		While I was in middle school, I was apart of an after school program that focused on theatre for the young. In that time, I did 4 productions and worked on various crews such as Lighting and Sound.</p>
